# Memantine and Alzheimerâ€™s disease effects on NMDA-receptor blockade
_This code accompanies Lanskey et al. (2024)._

The code runs on Matlab 2020b and uses SPM12 v7771, which is freely available:

## Analysis steps
The analysis is run in the following order:
1. Preprocessing, using same pipeline as dcm_cmc paper, please see [/jlansk/dcm_cmc_nmda/scripts/1_preprocessing](https://github.com/jlansk/dcm_cmc_ntad/tree/main/scripts/1_preprocessing)
2. Sensor space analysis and magnesium block switch plot, please see folder [sensor](https://github.com/jlansk/NMDA_blockade/tree/main/scripts/sensor)
3. Part 1: First-level [DCM inversion](https://github.com/jlansk/NMDA_blockade/blob/main/scripts/part1/invert_memcons_alpha_v1.m) followed by [PEB](https://github.com/jlansk/NMDA_blockade/blob/main/scripts/part1/PEBs_memcons_alpha_v1.m) of memantine versus placebo in healthy controls, folder [part1](https://github.com/jlansk/NMDA_blockade/tree/main/scripts/part1)
4. Part 2: First-level DCM inversions ([baseline](https://github.com/jlansk/NMDA_blockade/blob/main/scripts/part2/invert_BL_alpha_v1.m) and [follow-up](https://github.com/jlansk/NMDA_blockade/blob/main/scripts/part2/invert_AF_alpha_v1.m) sessions) followed by [PEBs](https://github.com/jlansk/NMDA_blockade/blob/main/scripts/part2/PEBs_ntad_alpha_v1.m) of people with Alzheimer's disease, folder [part2](https://github.com/jlansk/NMDA_blockade/tree/main/scripts/part2)
